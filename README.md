Vaadin Spring Boot demo
==
This is a small Vaadin application generated using [start.spring.io](http://start.spring.io)
It uses JPA and Spring Data repository for storing data. Originally presented at Spring I/O 2015, Barcelona.

The application has two views: [ListView](src/main/java/demo/ListView.java) component for listing
GPS data and [MapView](src/main/java/demo/MapView.java).

Application is ready configuration for any Spring Boot/Vaadin application. The [backend classes](src/main/java/demo/backend) are only for demonstration and you most likely want to re-use your existing entities.
